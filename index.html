				<p><i>“Do something that makes you feel happy, so it doesn’t feel like working. My dad worked hard at the produce market in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx, but he didn’t love it, so he was unhappy. That experience made me move towards something I really wanted to do because otherwise, I would feel trapped like him. Sometimes negative experiences can lead you in a positive direction.”</i></p>
